What I'd REALLY like to put in (but haven't made for want of a good way to integrate it) is having a sort of Arkham for the magical world; the most powerful men and deranged cultists and murderers end up here, awaiting either their execution or their trial (I imagine many powerful murder-hobo parties could end up here for their crimes). However, past the high-security nature of the dungeon is an even darker secret: the prison is a front for what's under it. Deep beneath the prison are things that fill the nightmares of those that have seen them. This prison is like the SCP Foundation of the D&D world; a place where the forgotten eldritch monsters and sentient evil artifacts are kept.
The prison was built above it to excuse the massive amount of magical security and to ensure no one would want to dig too deep into the facility's activities. But that secret will come out; a prison break occurs and if the party gets mixed up in it they'll soon realize that the murderers are the least of their worries as the fail-safes holding the monsters at bay slowly fail. The government of the land will do anything to contain a breached prison, so the PCs are left alone and trapped in a crumbling horror house of demonic items and Lovecraftian beasts.

Symbaroum has corruption. Kind of like reverse mana-casting.

Characters typically have a Toughness threshold of 10-12, which also sets their limit for temporary and permanent corruption. A typical spell or ritual will generate 1d4 temporary corruption, with more powerful spells generating 1d6. This corruption racks up during the course of a scene (a fight or situation), and goes away after the scene is finished, but should it go over your Toughness threshold it rolls into permanent corruption.

Permanent corruption is very hard to mitigate, almost impossible to get rid of without great cost, and is much easier to simply hide if a character gets enough of it. Get enough permanent corruption, and you start getting stigmas which are visible signs of corruption, and mark you as a target for witchhunters. Get half your Toughness value in permanent corruption, and your character dies, becoming an immediately hostile NPC abomination. Remember, that's a threshold of only 5-6 permanent corruption, and three or four unlucky spell castings can net you one.

Basically, you trade power for corruption, or reign in that power and use it sparingly so you don't taint your soul. You can also go out of your way to mitigate what corruption you gain, but that's not feasible in many situations, or just accept that corruption is something you trade for power, and plunge your characters forward into nihilism that will eventually claim their very beings.
